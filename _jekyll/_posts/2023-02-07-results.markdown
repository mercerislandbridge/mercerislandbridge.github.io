Thanks for coming to tonight's game.

Thanks for a great turnout and welcome to several new faces; was the first time playing a Mitchell in quite a while :)

First overall and first E/W were Adam and Eric, followed by Brian and Shawn and Brad and Susan.
First N/S were Thang and Greg, followed by Ray and Jeff, with Aaron and Donald third.

Hope to see you at our unit sectional Feb 17-19!
