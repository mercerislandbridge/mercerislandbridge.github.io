Thanks for coming to tonight's game. Overall winners were Bryan Delfs and Sue Anderson, with Dex Stuberg and Joel Fuhrman in second and Jeff Ford and Kim Eng in third. In B, Cornel Galer and Bogdan Vulcan were first, followed by Kevin Cline and David Hankins in second and Terry Jacobson and Brad Rind in third. There were no placings in C tonight due to the ACBL strats for the NAP.

A reminder to all that we will have our annual Fourth of July party on 2 July. Please bring something to share and come celebrate with us! Hope to see you there!
