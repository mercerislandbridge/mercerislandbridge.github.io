Thanks for coming to tonight's game. It was great to see Raj back visiting!

The next two weeks will be upgraded club championships which means extra masterpoints for the same cost. Bring a new friend out to the game!

Winners tonight were Chris and Brian with a nice 65% game. Winning Flight B and second overall were Nick and Galen.
