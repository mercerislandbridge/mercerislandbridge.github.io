Thanks for coming to tonight's game. Congratulations to all the winners - Jeff and David T in Flight A, the Dongs in Flight B, and Aaron and Beatrix in Flight C.

We will have a Junior Fund game next week - same price, more masterpoints.

In two weeks we will have a GNT Qualifier. If you need help finding a team, let us know.
