Thanks for coming to tonight's game. We really appreciate everyone who came out for our reopening game, and we hope to see more of you in the future! We have a very nice space at the JCC - plenty of room for everyone.

Our winners tonight were Jeff Ford and Ray Miller edging out two other pairs (Mike and Mike and Kevin and Becky) by half a matchpoint.
