Thanks for coming to tonight's game. Congratulations to our winners Eric Sieg and Aaron Mohrman who didn't even know they were playing together until just before game time. Second place went to Bogdan Vulcan and Beau Hovda.

We are considering having a GNT Swiss Teams game. Let us know what you think!
