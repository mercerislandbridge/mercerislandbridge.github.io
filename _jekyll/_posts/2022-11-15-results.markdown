Thanks for coming to tonight's game.

Congratulations to winners Becky and Mike.

Based on our informal poll this evening, not enough of our players will be here to make for a viable club game during the Phoenix NABC on 11/29, so we intend to cancel that game; official confirmation will come separately.
