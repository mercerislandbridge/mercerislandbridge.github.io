Thanks for coming to tonight's game.

Congratulations to Brian Zaugg and Mike Ring who edged out Pete Cowles and Clay Laughary by half a matchpoint!

Because so many of our regular attendees are in Phoenix there is no game next Tuesday. See you in December! We will have a regular game on December 13th and then we have our holiday party on December 20th.
