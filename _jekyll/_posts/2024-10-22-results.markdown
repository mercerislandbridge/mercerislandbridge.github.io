Thanks for coming to tonight's game. We know that lighting and temperature has not been ideal the last couple weeks. We will try to sync with the center to get these fixed, and we appreciate your patience.

Our winners tonight were Stan and Cornel. Winning E/W (and it's great to have enough tables to announce this!) were a tie between Joe and Lak and Kim and Jeff.
