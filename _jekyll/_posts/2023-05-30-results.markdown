Thanks for coming to tonight's game. Congratulations to all the winners at the KO Sectional this past weekend.

We will be holding NAP qualifier games next Tuesday and June 20. These games will still be the usual price, but award extra masterpoints and give you a chance to qualify for the District event later this year.

Our winners today were Jeff Ford and David Taylor. Second was Arvind Ranasaria and Krishnan Ramaratnam. Third and winning Flight B were Aaron Mohrman and Kevin Cline.
