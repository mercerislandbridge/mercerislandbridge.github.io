Thanks for coming to tonight's game. It was wonderful to see everyone. 9 full tables even with many of our regulars missing!
Best of luck to everyone playing in Lynnwood next week. Remember, no game for Mercercrest next Tuesday, closed for Lynnwood. We're back at full strength on the 26th, with an NAP qualifier. Come join us!

Tonight's winners were Sue and Oyvind E/W, and the returning star Liliana Diaconescu, inspired by her new puppies, winning N/S.
