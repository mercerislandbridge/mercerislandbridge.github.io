Thanks for coming to tonight's game - it was great to see so many players tonight. If you enjoy playing evening bridge please also come out to the Thursday night game at 13 Top Tricks!

Next week will be our quarterly club championship. We will be closed on December 2, and we will have a Holiday Party and Swiss Teams on December 16.

Our winners tonight were Stan and Cornel, closely followed by Kim and Eric. The Dong's won the other direction with the Kasperkiewicz's in second and winning Flight C.
