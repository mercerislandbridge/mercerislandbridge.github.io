Thanks for coming to tonight's game. It was great to see everyone for bridge!

Our winners tonight were Sue and Beau, edging out Mike and Bryan by just half a matchpoint. Lisa and Craig won flight C.

Good luck to everyone playing GNTs - if you haven't signed up, the Open and B flights are this weekend!
