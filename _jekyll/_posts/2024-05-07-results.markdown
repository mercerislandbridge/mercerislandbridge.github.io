Thanks for coming to tonight's game. Our next special game will be a Club Championship on May 21.

As a reminder, we have a hard stop, so it's important to keep up with the clock. There's no opportunity to add time - if we don't stick to it we will just lose the last round.

Our winners tonight were Kim Eng and Chris Moore. Flights B and C were won by Aaron Mohrman and John Krah.
