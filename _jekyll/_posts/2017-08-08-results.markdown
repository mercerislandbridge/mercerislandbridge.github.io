Thanks for coming to tonight's game.

I'd like to extend a special welcome to our new player tonight, Praveen Holenarsipur, and to a few folks who've been playing with us from time to time lately, Bruce, Jeannie, Cord, Tracey, Steven, and Grant.

Please note we'll be closed during the week of the Regional (in Lynnwood), which is Aug 22nd. We're having our last NAP qualifier of the year on Aug 29th, so come play and tell us your stories of success from Lynnwood.

Tonight's winners were Dennis and Connie, who narrowly edged out Dave and Rose. East/West winners were Brad and Terry just ahead of John and Daniel.
