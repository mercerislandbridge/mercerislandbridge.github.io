Thanks for coming to tonight's game. It was great to see faces that we haven't seen for a while tonight! I hope that everyone has had a good holiday season and has an even better 2023.

There was a tie for first tonight between Brad Rind and Susan Waggoner and Kim Eng and Jeff Ford. Brad and Susan also won flights B and C.
