Thanks for coming to tonight's game.

Next week we will be having our annual Celebrate America game! It will be a Club Championship, and we would ask for you to bring something to share with the group. Note that because of site restrictions no meat or fish is allowed.

We are likely to be closed later in the month during the Toronto NABC -- we will make an announcement next week.

Winners tonight were Shawn and Brian tied with Chris and Adam. Congrats to the winners!
