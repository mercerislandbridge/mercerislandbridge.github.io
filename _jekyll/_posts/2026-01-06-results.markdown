Thanks for coming to tonight's game. I hope that everyone had a happy holiday season!

Next week we will have a Junior Fund game. This helps fund youth bridge - extra masterpoints for the same cost - the club picks up the extra fee!

Our winners tonight were the Mikes just ahead of Cornel and Dave G. Flight B winners were Hugh and Laura. Flight C winners were Arjun and Mudit.
