Thanks for coming to tonight's game. It was great to see so many new faces in the learner game, and two new people in the open game as well.  Our winners tonight were Adam Ruprecht and Chris Jarvis.

Next week we may be in a different room, but we will be directing people appropriately as you sign in.

We will also be back on track for offering special games soon -- look for an announcement next week.
