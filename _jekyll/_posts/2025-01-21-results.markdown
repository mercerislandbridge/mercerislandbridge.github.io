Thanks for coming to tonight's game. Some of the proceeds from the game will be supporting youth bridge!

Our winners tonight were Brian Zaugg and David Wright who also won Flight B. Flight C winners were Dex Stuberg and Cliff Marx.

Next week is a GNT Qualifier - teams of four, so let us know if you need help finding a team.
