Thanks for coming to tonight's game.

Our winners tonight were Ray Miller and Bogdan Vulcan. Second place went to the Mikes.

We had a few boards not get played tonight because people played the wrong boards. Please do remember to check your boards at the beginning of each round, and to pass the boards at the end of each round.
