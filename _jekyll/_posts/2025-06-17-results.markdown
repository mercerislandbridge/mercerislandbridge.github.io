Thanks for coming to tonight's Club Championship game. Our overall winners were Bogdan and Cornel. East/West winners were Joe and Lak.

Next week will be our last week at SJCC - let's have a great last game!

Then the week after we will start playing at 13 Top Tricks with a party and another Club Championship. Game time will remain at 6:45 and we will continue to be done by 10.
