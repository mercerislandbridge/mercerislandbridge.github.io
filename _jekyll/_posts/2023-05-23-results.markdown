Thanks for coming to tonight's game. We will be having two NAP qualifiers in June on the first and third Tuesdays.

The church has told us they will not be renewing our lease so we are looking for another place to play starting in July. We would prefer to stay in a central location so that we can get players from Seattle and the Eastside. If you have any potential sites please let us know.

Congratulations to Stan and Bryan with a 66% game to win tonight. Adam and Chris finished second and won Flights B and C.
