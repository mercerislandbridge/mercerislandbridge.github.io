Thanks for coming to tonight's game. In two weeks we will be having our annual holiday party. Please come play bridge and bring a treat to share. (And remember that our current location does not allow meat.)

Our winners tonight (and also Flight B winners) were Brian and Aaron. Winning Flight C were Chris and Adam.

Ray and Ann we hope you get better soon!
