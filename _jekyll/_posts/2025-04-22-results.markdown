Thanks for coming to tonight's game. It was great to have so many people here, but a little chaotic at the beginning. We need to start promptly at 6:45 to get out on time. If you know you are going to be late please call or text Jeff at 425-761-8433.

Next week will be a Club Appreciation Game - extra masterpoints!

Oyvind and Shawn won N/S edging out Mike C and David W overall who won E/W.
