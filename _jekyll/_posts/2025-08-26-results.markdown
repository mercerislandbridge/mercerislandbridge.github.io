Thanks for coming to tonight's game. This was our last NAP qualifier. The District Finals will be right back here at 13 Top Tricks, so if you qualified make sure you make plans to play there!

Next week is a regular game and the week after that is a Junior Fund game.

It was tight at the top tonight - congratulations to Paul and Brad!
