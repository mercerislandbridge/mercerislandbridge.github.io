Thanks for coming to tonight's game.

We have sad news to share -- Don Stark has passed away. His funeral will be this Friday at 11:00 at Butterworth Funeral Home, 520 W Rave St. in Seattle. The usual Friday morning game at Seattle Bridge Center is canceled this week.

There is a Barometer Pairs Unit Game at 13 Top Tricks on Friday night this week. Sign up at their site so Joe knows how many boards to make.

Winners in all three flights tonight were Genie and Jin!
