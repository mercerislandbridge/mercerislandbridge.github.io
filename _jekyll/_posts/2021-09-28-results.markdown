Thanks for coming to tonight's game. Congrats to tonight's winners Jeff and Kim with a 72% game!

We'll be playing with extra masterpoints for the rest of 2021! We have enough remaining club championships to play club championships or special events through the rest of the year. Come out and take advantage of it!
