Thanks for coming to tonight's game. It was great to see some faces that we haven't seen for a while.

Congratulations to Chris Jarvis and Valliappa Lakshmanan who won in all three flights tonight.

The ACBL is now awarding extra masterpoints for live games that play more than 18 boards. Unfortunately they haven't updated ACBLScore to show the changes, so if you care about your exact points check out ACBL Live for Clubs.
