Thanks for coming to tonight's game. Because the B4Y game was a team game there isn't a web page for those results tonight.

Our winners tonight (in all flights!) were Music Li and ZH Sun. Sue Anderson and Becky Stevens finished second.

Good luck to everyone playing in the Everett Sectional this weekend!

We will have a regular game next week, but we will be closed on the Tuesday after (during the New Orleans NABC).
