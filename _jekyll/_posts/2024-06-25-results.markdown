Thanks for coming to tonight's game. Please remember that we have a hard stop at 10:00, so we need to start on time and play to the clock. We are going to need to start the game with whoever is here at game time unless you have let us know you are on the way.

Winners tonight were Mike Christensen and David Wright. Second place and winning B and C were Oyvind and Shawn.
