Thanks for coming to tonight's game. In two weeks, on June 4 we will have an NAP qualifier. The week after that the game will be at 13 Top Tricks since the Jewish Community Center will be closed.

Our winners tonight were Jeff and Kim, 1/2 matchpoint ahead of Eric and Kenny. Flights B and C were won by Dex and Cliff.
