Thanks for coming to tonight's game. It was great to see so many new and old faces!

In the smaller game the winners were Qian Liang and Yanchun Gu.

In the GNT Qualifier the winners were Brian Delfs, Jenni Carmichael, Stan Christie, and Kevin Bolan. Flight B winners were Arthur and Nathan Gong and Frank and Gianna Hsieh.

We will be back next week with a pair game.

Team results don't always show up well at our web site, so check out ACBL Live for Clubs to get those.
