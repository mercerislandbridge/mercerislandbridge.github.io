I"k<p>Thanks for coming to tonight’s game.</p>

<p>We hope we’ll see you next week at our Holiday Party! Please bring a festive attitude and a snack to share. It’s also a club championship, so there will be extra masterpoints!</p>

<p>We will be closed the week after on December 26. Starting in January the game will be $10.</p>

<p>Congratulations to tonight’s winners - Ken Christiansen and Dave Setterholm. They finished just ahead of John Krah and Daniel Poore who won Flights B &amp; C. Our N/S winners were Kim Eng and Eric Sieg.</p>
