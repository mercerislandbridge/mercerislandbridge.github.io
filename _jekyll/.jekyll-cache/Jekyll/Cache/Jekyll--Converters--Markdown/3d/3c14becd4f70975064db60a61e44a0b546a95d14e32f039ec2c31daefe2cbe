I"-<p>Thanks for coming to tonight’s game. Congratulations to all our club regulars who did well at the KO Sectional this past weekend.</p>

<p>There is a special Barometer Pairs put on by the Unit at Eastside Bridge Center on Sunday afternoon. In this event all pairs play the same boards at the same time, and you know where you stand after each round. In order to make the right number of boards, they need signups at unitgames@bridgeinseattle.org. Hope to see you there.</p>

<p>We will be having our first North American Pairs qualifier in two weeks on June 13.</p>

<p>Tonight’s winners were Eric Sieg and Jenni Carmichael. Flight B winners were Brian Zaugg and Shawn Abernethy. Flight C winners were John Krah and Daniel Poore.</p>
