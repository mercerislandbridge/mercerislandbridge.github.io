I"(<p>Thanks for coming to tonightâ€™s game.</p>

<p>In two weeks we will be having a GNT Qualifier - this means you need a team of four not just a pair. If you are looking for a team, let us know and we will help people get matched up.</p>

<p>As a reminder this winter any time there is bad weather we will follow the Mercer Island school system for whether we are open.</p>

<p>Our winners tonight were Chris Moore and Kim Eng. N/S winners were Brian Zaugg and David Wright.</p>
