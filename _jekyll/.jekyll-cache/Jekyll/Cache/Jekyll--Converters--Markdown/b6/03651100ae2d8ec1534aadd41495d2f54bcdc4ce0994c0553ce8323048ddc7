I"y<p>Thanks for coming to tonightâ€™s game.</p>

<p>Best of luck to everyone going to Leavenworth this week.</p>

<p>Tonights winners were Eric and Victor, and I believe I should get an honorable mention for helping them win via poor decisions. Shawn and Aaron were second, and the Mikes were third.</p>
