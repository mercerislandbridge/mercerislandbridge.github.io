I"<p>Thanks for coming to tonight’s game.</p>

<p>Congrats to everyone who did well in Lynnwood, and best of luck to everyone headed down to Olympia this weekend. Don’t forget there’s another Seattle sectional, the last of the year, coming up in mid-September.</p>

<p>Tonight Gary and Sharon won both A and B, and because we had to use NAP strats we weren’t able to have a C strat. But we’ll be back to our normal strats from here.</p>

<p>Thanks again!</p>
