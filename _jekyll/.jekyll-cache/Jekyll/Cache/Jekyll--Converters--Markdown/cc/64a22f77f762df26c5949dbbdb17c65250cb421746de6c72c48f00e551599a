I"H<p>Thanks for coming to tonightâ€™s game. The extra money collected tonight goes to support the ACBL Junior program. One of our very own juniors, Greg Herman, is in China right now in the World Junior Championships. If you look at the Vugraph schedule on BBO over the next few days, there may be a chance to watch him play!</p>
