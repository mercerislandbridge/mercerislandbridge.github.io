I"Æ<p>Thanks for coming to tonightâ€™s game.</p>

<p>Congratulations to Brian Zaugg and Mike Ring who edged out Pete Cowles and Clay Laughary by half a matchpoint!</p>

<p>Because so many of our regular attendees are in Phoenix there is no game next Tuesday. See you in December! We will have a regular game on December 13th and then we have our holiday party on December 20th.</p>
