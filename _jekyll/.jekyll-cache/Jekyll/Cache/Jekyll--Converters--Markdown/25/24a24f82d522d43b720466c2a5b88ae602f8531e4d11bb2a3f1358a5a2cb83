I"ç<p>Thanks for coming to tonightâ€™s game. Our next special game will be a Club Championship on May 21.</p>

<p>As a reminder, we have a hard stop, so itâ€™s important to keep up with the clock. Thereâ€™s no opportunity to add time - if we donâ€™t stick to it we will just lose the last round.</p>

<p>Our winners tonight were Kim Eng and Chris Moore. Flights B and C were won by Aaron Mohrman and John Krah.</p>
