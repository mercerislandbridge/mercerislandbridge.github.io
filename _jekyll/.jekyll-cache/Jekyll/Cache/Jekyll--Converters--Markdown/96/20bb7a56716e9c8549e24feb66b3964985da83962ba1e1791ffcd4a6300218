I"“<p>Thanks for coming to tonightâ€™s game.</p>

<p>Congratulations to winners Becky and Mike.</p>

<p>Based on our informal poll this evening, not enough of our players will be here to make for a viable club game during the Phoenix NABC on 11/29, so we intend to cancel that game; official confirmation will come separately.</p>
