I"k<p>Thanks for coming to tonight’s game.</p>

<p>We’re open every Tuesday this month, so please come out. You can only take so much relatives before you need a break! There are holiday parties at both SBC and ESBC this weekend. SBC’s game is teams, ESBC’s game is pairs.</p>

<p>Congrats to Jen and Bryan, who won tonight pending any errors. The two Mikes were second, and won E/W.</p>
