I"B<p>Thanks for coming to tonightâ€™s game. Good luck to our players who are in Atlanta for the NABC!</p>

<p>Next week will be a Unit Championship - extra masterpoints for the same price.</p>

<p>We are going to go back to collecting money at the game. You still need to show your card at the front to get in, but you no longer need to pre-purchase entries on the website.</p>

<p>Our winners tonight were Jeff and Kim. Second place and winning B were Sue and David. Winning C were Shawn and Oyvind.</p>
