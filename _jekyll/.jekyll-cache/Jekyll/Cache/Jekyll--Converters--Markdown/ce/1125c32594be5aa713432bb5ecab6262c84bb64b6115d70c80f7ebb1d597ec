I"Ý<p>Thanks for coming to tonightâ€™s game. I hope that everyone had a happy holiday season!</p>

<p>Next week we will have a Junior Fund game. This helps fund youth bridge - extra masterpoints for the same cost - the club picks up the extra fee!</p>

<p>Our winners tonight were the Mikes just ahead of Cornel and Dave G. Flight B winners were Hugh and Laura. Flight C winners were Arjun and Mudit.</p>
