I"Ù<p>Thanks for coming to tonightâ€™s game.</p>

<p>Iâ€™d like to extend a special welcome to our new player tonight, Praveen Holenarsipur, and to a few folks whoâ€™ve been playing with us from time to time lately, Bruce, Jeannie, Cord, Tracey, Steven, and Grant.</p>

<p>Please note weâ€™ll be closed during the week of the Regional (in Lynnwood), which is Aug 22nd. Weâ€™re having our last NAP qualifier of the year on Aug 29th, so come play and tell us your stories of success from Lynnwood.</p>

<p>Tonightâ€™s winners were Dennis and Connie, who narrowly edged out Dave and Rose. East/West winners were Brad and Terry just ahead of John and Daniel.</p>
