I"™<p>Thanks for coming to tonightâ€™s game.</p>

<p>Best of luck to everyone in San Diego; we should be back to a normal game next week.</p>

<p>Shawn managed to drag her client to victory, which is probably even harder than it sounds. Kevin and David won B, and Brad and Terry pretended theyâ€™re in C and won that. Congrats to all.</p>
