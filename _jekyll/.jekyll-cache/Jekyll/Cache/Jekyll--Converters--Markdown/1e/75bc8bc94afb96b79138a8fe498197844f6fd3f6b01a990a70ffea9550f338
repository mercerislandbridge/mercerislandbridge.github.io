I"Õ<p>Thanks for coming to tonightâ€™s game.</p>

<p>It was very nice to welcome Christine and Lynn to our club. Welcome back to Oyvind, Cord, Dennis and Connie, and Arvind.</p>

<p>Tonightsâ€™ winners were David and Kevin. Winning N/S were Chris and Ray (probably more Chris than Ray). Galen and Leah tied Jack and Rex for first in B one direction, and Brad and John won B and C the other way.</p>
