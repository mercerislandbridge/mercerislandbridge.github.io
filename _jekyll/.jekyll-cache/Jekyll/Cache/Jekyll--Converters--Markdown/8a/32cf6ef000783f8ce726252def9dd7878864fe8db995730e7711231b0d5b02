I"—<p>Thanks for coming to tonightâ€™s game.</p>

<p>Tonightâ€™s winners were Jeff and Mr. Miller. Jeffâ€™s reward for winning was to spend lots of extra time figuring out why I couldnâ€™t send the results out last night. Iâ€™m sorry theyâ€™re 12 hours late, but a couple of successive problems slowed us down. First E/W was our esteemed SUN editor, David Wright, and whatever client he was carrying.</p>

<p>Two weeks from now (10/16) is a club appreciation game, which usually means extra masterpoints but no extra cost.</p>

<p>Best of luck to anyone in or headed to Seaside this week.</p>
