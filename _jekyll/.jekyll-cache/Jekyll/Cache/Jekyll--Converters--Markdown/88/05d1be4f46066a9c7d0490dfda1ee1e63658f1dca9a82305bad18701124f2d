I"f<p>Thanks for coming to tonightâ€™s game. We will be having two NAP qualifiers in June on the first and third Tuesdays.</p>

<p>The church has told us they will not be renewing our lease so we are looking for another place to play starting in July. We would prefer to stay in a central location so that we can get players from Seattle and the Eastside. If you have any potential sites please let us know.</p>

<p>Congratulations to Stan and Bryan with a 66% game to win tonight. Adam and Chris finished second and won Flights B and C.</p>
