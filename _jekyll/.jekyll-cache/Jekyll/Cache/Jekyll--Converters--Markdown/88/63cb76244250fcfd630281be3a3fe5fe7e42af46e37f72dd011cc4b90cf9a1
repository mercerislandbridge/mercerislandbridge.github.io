I"l<p>Thanks for coming to tonight’s game.</p>

<p>We are having some special games coming up. In two week we will have a Junior Fund game - extra masterpoints for the same price. In three weeks on January 28 we will host a team game and GNT qualifier. If you are a pair looking for a team let us know. Also while advance signups aren’t required for the GNT game it helps us a lot if we know you are coming.</p>

<p>Winners tonight were Jeff and Ray, and Flight B and C winners were Lak and Joe. Our Fun Bridge winners were Ted and Bernie.</p>
