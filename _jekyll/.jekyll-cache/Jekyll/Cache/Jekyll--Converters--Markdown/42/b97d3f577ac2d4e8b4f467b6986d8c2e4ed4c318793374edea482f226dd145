I"B<p>Thanks for coming to tonight’s game.</p>

<p>Next week we will be having our annual Celebrate America game! It will be a Club Championship, and we would ask for you to bring something to share with the group. Note that because of site restrictions no meat or fish is allowed.</p>

<p>We are likely to be closed later in the month during the Toronto NABC – we will make an announcement next week.</p>

<p>Winners tonight were Shawn and Brian tied with Chris and Adam. Congrats to the winners!</p>
