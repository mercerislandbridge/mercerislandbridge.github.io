I"<p>Thanks for coming to tonight’s game. Because the B4Y game was a team game there isn’t a web page for those results tonight.</p>

<p>Our winners tonight (in all flights!) were Music Li and ZH Sun. Sue Anderson and Becky Stevens finished second.</p>

<p>Good luck to everyone playing in the Everett Sectional this weekend!</p>

<p>We will have a regular game next week, but we will be closed on the Tuesday after (during the New Orleans NABC).</p>
