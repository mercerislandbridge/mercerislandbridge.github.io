I"r<p>Thanks for coming to tonight’s game.</p>

<p>Best of luck to everyone going to Everett this weekend, and to Memphis after! And a welcome back to Kevin who hasn’t been with us in a while.</p>

<p>Please consider signing up for the Round Robin if you haven’t already. It’s flighted, and very social, and fun, a great chance to spend an evening with players you might not otherwise at their home. Highly recommended.</p>

<p>Tonight’s winners were Joel Fuhrman and David Walker! Congrats. Second were Sue and DT! Third were Al and Andrea.</p>
