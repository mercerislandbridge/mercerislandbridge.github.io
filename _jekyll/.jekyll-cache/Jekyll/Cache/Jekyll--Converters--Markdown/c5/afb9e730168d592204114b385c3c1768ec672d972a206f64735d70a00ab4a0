I"<p>Thanks for coming to tonightâ€™s game. Good luck to everyone playing in Seaside!</p>

<p>Tonight we say a fond farewell to Pete Cowles, at least for a while - who would ever think that the Caribbean was a better place to spend the winter than Seattle?</p>

<p>Our top three places tonight were separated by only one matchpoint so check your scores. :) First was Bryan Delfs and Jen Chalfan, second were the Whites and third were Kim Eng and Chris Moore.</p>
