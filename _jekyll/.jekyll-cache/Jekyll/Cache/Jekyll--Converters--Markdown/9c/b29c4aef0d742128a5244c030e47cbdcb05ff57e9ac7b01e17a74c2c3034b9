I"Ü<p>Thanks for coming to tonightâ€™s game. Next week is an ACBL-Wide Charity Game. There will be scoring across the district and country for overall masterpoint awards in addition to the extra awards at the club.</p>

<p>Our winners tonight were Stan Christie and first time visitor Katrin Litwin - welcome to the club! Winners in Flight B and C were Karen Hudesman and Don Stark.</p>

<p>The strats tonight were a bit unbalanced between N/S and E/W. Please make sure to sit at a table that matches your masterpoint total when you arrive. If there arenâ€™t any, please ask a director so we can make sure the game stays balanced.</p>

<p>See you next week!</p>
