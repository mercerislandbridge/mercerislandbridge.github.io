I"è<p>Thanks for coming to tonight‚Äôs game. We appreciate your patience as we dealt with the boards from a week ago.</p>

<p>The winners tonight were Mike Develin and Jason Rosenfeld with a 74% game. Well done! Our East/West winners were Nelson Davis and Rex Tu.</p>

<p>Our next special game is the first Tuesday of May. We will have a Grassroots Fund game which gets money to help with the travel of our District GNT and NAP winners. This past weekend in Victoria regulars Tim White, Ann Romeo, and Beau Hovda won a trip to Las Vegas that is partially supported by those games.</p>
