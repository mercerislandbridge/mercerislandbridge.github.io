I"Ì<p>Thanks for coming to tonightâ€™s game. We know that lighting and temperature has not been ideal the last couple weeks. We will try to sync with the center to get these fixed, and we appreciate your patience.</p>

<p>Our winners tonight were Stan and Cornel. Winning E/W (and itâ€™s great to have enough tables to announce this!) were a tie between Joe and Lak and Kim and Jeff.</p>
