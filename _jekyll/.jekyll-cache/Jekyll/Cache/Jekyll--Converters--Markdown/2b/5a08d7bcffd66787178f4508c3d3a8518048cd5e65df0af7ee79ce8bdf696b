I"Ë<p>Thanks for coming to tonightâ€™s game. If you havenâ€™t seen the new site, come give it a try next week!</p>

<p>Our winners tonight were Mike Ring and Mike Christensen. Flight B and C winners were  Changtiaorap Lanchew and Genie Thai-Ma.</p>

<p>There is a new website for online bridge that started last week at <a href="https://swangames.com.">https://swangames.com.</a> They are trying to get a West Coast game going on Thursday evenings, so if that sounds fun for you check it out. This pays out masterpoints, and also has audio and video like the site we used during Covid. The first several games are free if you sign up now.</p>
