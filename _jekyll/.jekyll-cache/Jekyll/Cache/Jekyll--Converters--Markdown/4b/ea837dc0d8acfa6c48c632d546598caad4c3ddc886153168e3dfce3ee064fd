<p>Thanks for coming to tonightâ€™s game. In two weeks we will be having a Junior Fund game - this costs $1 extra that goes to support Under-25 Bridge, and the winners all get extra masterpoints.</p>

<p>Tonightâ€™s winners in all three flights were Erik Sieg and Lak Lakshmanan with a huge 67% game. Congratulations!</p>
