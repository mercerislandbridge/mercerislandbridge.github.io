I"t<p>Thanks for coming to tonightâ€™s game. The extra money collected tonight goes to support the ACBL Junior program. One of our very own juniors, Greg Herman, is in China right now in the World Junior Championships. If you look at the Vugraph schedule on BBO over the next few days, there may be a chance to watch him play!</p>

<p>Our winners tonight in all flights were Clay and Pete. Congratulations! Winners East/West were Joel and Dex.</p>

<p>Next week is a normal game, and then we will be closed the week after that for the Lynnwood Regional.</p>
