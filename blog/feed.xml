Please remember that we want to start the game at 6:45 to ensure we are done by 10:00. This means we need people to arrive 5-10 minutes before that so that we can get everything started. If you are running late, please call or text someone so that we are sure that you are on your way. It is frequently the case that the movement is completely different if one person doesn’t show up.</p>

<p>Our winners tonight were Nathan and John in all three flights - Congratulations! Bryan and Stan won in the other direction.</p>

<p>Our next special game will be a Club Championship in two weeks.</p>
